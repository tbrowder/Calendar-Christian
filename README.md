NAME
====

Calendar::Christian - Dates of the Christian church year

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Calendar::Christian;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Calendar::Christian** is a Raku module similar to the format of Raku module **Holidays::US::Federal** in that it provides a list of the major events of the Christian calendar recognized by most Christian churches in the US as well as other parts of the world. The source of the event dates has been Wikipedia as well as online information from the Episcopal Church and the Catholic Church.

OVERVIEW
========

Some churches use a special church calendar. Days and seasons within the year may be either "fasts" (solemn times) or "feasts" (joyful times). The year is structured around the greatest feast in the calendar, the festival of the Resurrection of Jesus, known as Easter, and the second greatest feast, the festival of the Nativity of Jesus, known as Christmas. Before Christmas and Easter there are solemn fast seasons known as Advent and Lent, respectively. After Christmas comes the feast of Epiphany, and after Easter comes the feast of Pentecost. These days have the adjacent seasons named after them.

The church's new year falls on Advent Sunday, which occurs around the start of December. Then follows the four-week fast season of Advent, then comes the Christmas season, which lasts twelve days; then comes Epiphany, then the forty days of Lent. Then comes Easter, then the long season of Pentecost (which some churches call Trinity, after the feast which falls soon after Pentecost). Then the next year begins and we return to Advent again.

Every Sunday is the feast day of Jesus, and if it has no other name is numbered according to the season in which it falls. So, for example, the third Sunday in Pentecost season would be called Pentecost 3.
