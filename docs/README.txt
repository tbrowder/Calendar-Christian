Orignal README for DateTime::Calendar::Liturgical::Christian

This module will return the name, season, week number and liturgical
colour for any day in the Gregorian calendar. It will eventually
support the liturgical calendars of several churches (hopefully at
least Anglican, Lutheran, Orthodox and Roman Catholic). At present it
only knows the calendar for the Episcopal Church of the USA.
